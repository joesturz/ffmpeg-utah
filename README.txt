These are files used to add a new codec to the ffmpeg library. The name of the codec is .utah and was a project developed as apart of the Spring 2013 CS 3505 class at the University of Utah.  These files were written by Joe Stuzenegger and Ian Noy.

This format was developed to gain experience in using a large code base, development in C C.

There is also included in this project an application which uses this .utah format to create a video of a ball bouncing on top of a provided image.

This does not contain the ffmpeg library and only has a few altered files used in this specific class project. For additional information on ffmpeg please go to http://ffmpeg.org
